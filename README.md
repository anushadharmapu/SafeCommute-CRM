# SafeCommute

**SafeCommute** is a Salesforce-based application that helps commuters report and track transport disruptions, safety hazards, and incidents in real time. It allows users like residents, travelers, and local authorities to share information and stay updated, improving safety and communication during daily travel.

This project is built using Salesforceâ€™s declarative tools such as Custom Objects, Workflows, and Lightning Components to ensure easy setup and secure access for users.
